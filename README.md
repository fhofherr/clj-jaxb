# clj-jaxb

Clojure wrapper around the Java API for XML Binding.

## What happened to lein-xjc?

`lein-xjc` and `clj-jaxb` are two closely related, but totally independent
projects. I initially thought it was a good idea to keep them in the same
repository. This turned out to be wrong. Therefore `lein-xjc` has moved to a [new
repository](https://github.com/fhofherr/lein-xjc).
